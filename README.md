# ScreenCapturerWorkaround

## Introduction
There are some programs that cannot properly handle DirectShow captures. This will result in the output being upside down. This is a workaround for [ScreenCapturer](https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free) that will make it possible for those programs to display the desktop without any problems. It is mainly for VideoLan v3.x (Windows versions) to allow it to stream the desktop fixing the upside down issue. Though, you can use it with any other program.

## How to use
1. Download the two .dll files from this project.
2. Download and install the latest version of [ScreenCapturer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/screencapturer/files/). I have used the 0.12.8 version to test this.
3. Go to the folder where you installed it and copy the .dll files from step 1 into that folder overwriting the files in there.
